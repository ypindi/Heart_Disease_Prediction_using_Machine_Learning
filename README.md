## 3 Description
### 3.1 KNN Algorithm
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbor and does prediction based on the proximity of other data points 
to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. 
It is also called case-based reasoning and has been used
in many applications like pattern recognition, statistical estimation.
KNN is preferred over other
classification algorithms due to its high convergence speed and
simplicity.

### 3.2 Support Vector Classifier
Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by finding an optimal line 
or hyperplane that maximizes the distance between each class in an N-dimensional space. Support
Vector Classifier is highly preferred by many as it produces significant
accuracy with less computation power. Support Vector Machine (or
SVM) can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But, it is
widely used in classification objectives. It is used in both linear
regression and logistic regression.
